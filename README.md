# WP-CDownload
A plugin that lets users download files only based on their access level.

This plugin requires some setup at the very least. 
* Make sure to keep the .htaccess files if you're using Apache or setup proper rules in nginx.
* Make sure to validate the user before giving him access to this file.
* At the very least this is a convinient file that can let users download files from the server.
